# Collage
Course project for "Graphical applications development"

That is the collage editor of natural compositions, which you can download. There are some images presented as a template. For custom layout you need to upload background and foreground objects (already matted, .png file format with alpha channel) and press the button "Create composition" for generation of layout. You also can move objects the way you want.
